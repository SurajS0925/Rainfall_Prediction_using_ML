# Rainfall_Prediction_using_ML
This study presents a set of experiments that involve the use of common machine learning techniques to create models that can predict whether it will rain tomorrow or not based on the weather data for that day in major cities in Australia.

About the dataset : This dataset comprises about 10 years of daily weather observations from numerous locations across Australia. It's like having a decade-long diary of the sky's mood swings.RainTomorrow is the target variable to predict.

Approach used : Logistic Regression for Solving Classification Problems
Logistic regression is a commonly used technique for solving binary classification problems. In a logistic regression model:
we take linear combination (or weighted sum of the input features)
we apply the sigmoid function to the result to obtain a number between 0 and 1
this number represents the probability of the input being classified as "Yes".
